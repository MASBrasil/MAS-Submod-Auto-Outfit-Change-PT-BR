# Auto Outfit Change
- This submod allows Monika to change her hairstyles, outfits, and accessories as she desires, fitting to the current weather and temperature (If Auto Atmos Change is installed) or just to the event at hand.
- It also allows a lot of customization. See the [ex_prop_explanation](game/Submods/Auto%20Hair%20Change/ex_prop_explanation.md) for details
- You can also plug your own functions using MAS's native Function Plugins, into the following functions to add handling for accessories too:
  - *store.ahc_utils.`changeHairAndClothes`*
  - *store.ahc_utils.`do_hair_logic`*
  - *store.ahc_utils.`do_clothes_logic`*
This submod is compatible with the [Submod Updater Plugin](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin/releases/latest)! Give it an install to make updating this submod easier.
